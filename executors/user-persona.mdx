# User Persona

Define realistic, evidence‑backed user personas that you can reuse across products for prioritization, testing, and simulations. Personas created here are first‑class objects: they can be converted into synthetic users, referenced in experiments, and used to segment analytics.

## Persona schema

Capture concise, testable attributes. Keep each field actionable and tied to evidence.

- Profile: name/label, role, seniority, industry/segment, geography
- Goals: desired outcomes and success criteria
- Pain points: blockers, risks, and constraints
- Behaviors: frequency of use, channels, decision style
- Environment: tools, data access, policies/compliance needs
- KPIs: how this persona measures success
- Compliance: privacy/PII sensitivity, guardrails
- Tags: segment labels used across the platform (e.g., "Ops", "Analyst")

<Tip>
Use short, specific statements instead of narratives. Link each statement to a source (ticket, interview, metric) so it stays trustworthy.
</Tip>

## Create a persona (step‑by‑step)

1) Start a new persona
- Go to Executors → User Persona → New Persona
- Select the product context (personas are scoped per product)

2) Seed from real data
- Paste notes from interviews, surveys, support tickets, or CRM
- Optionally upload a short transcript or summary

3) AI‑assisted drafting
- In Work Chat, ask: “Draft a persona for [role/segment] from these notes, list goals/pains/behaviors succinctly”
- Review the draft; accept or edit fields inline

4) Finalize structure
- Keep 3–5 bullets per section
- Add tags you will reuse in Opportunities, Simulations, and Analytics
- Save; the persona is versioned so later edits are tracked

<Note>
Avoid stereotypes. Base attributes on evidence and make them falsifiable through experiments.
</Note>

## Validate and evolve

- Triangulate: combine qualitative inputs (calls, interviews) with product analytics
- Quick check: run a 3–5 question survey to confirm top goals/pains
- Pilot: execute a small task flow; compare outcomes vs. persona KPIs
- Review cadence: revisit quarterly; merge or retire low‑signal personas

## Use personas across the platform

- Prioritization: link personas to Opportunities to make trade‑offs explicit
- Testing: convert personas to Synthetic Users for scenario coverage → see /executors/synthetic-users
- Simulations: assemble flows with multiple personas to validate UX and guardrails at scale → see /executors/simulations
- Analytics: segment Orion dashboards by persona tags to spot adoption gaps → see /workflows/orion
- Control: map persona constraints (privacy, PII, safety) to policies in Laila → see /workflows/laila
- Strategy: reference primary/secondary personas in Max to keep objectives user‑anchored → see /workflows/max

## Best practices

- Focus: keep 3–5 personas per product lifecycle phase
- Be measurable: tie each goal to at least one KPI you can observe
- Stay atomic: one persona = one coherent set of goals/behaviors
- Source links: attach citations (issue IDs, interview IDs, dashboard URLs)
- Update rhythm: schedule a quarterly review to prevent drift

## FAQs

- Multiple products? Personas are scoped to the selected product. Switch products from the sidebar; each product maintains its own persona set.
- Import/export? Paste structured JSON/Markdown or let Work Chat parse notes. Export personas as JSON for sharing.
- Permissions? Personas inherit the product’s access controls.
