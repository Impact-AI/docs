# Simulations

Simulations provide a powerful environment for running comprehensive tests of your AI systems under various scenarios and conditions, allowing you to validate performance before deployment.

## Key Features

- **Scenario Modeling**: Create complex interaction scenarios
- **Environment Control**: Simulate different conditions and constraints
- **Batch Processing**: Run multiple simulations simultaneously
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track simulation progress and results

## Getting Started

Design your simulation scenarios by combining user personas, interaction patterns, and environmental conditions to test your AI system's behavior.

## Use Cases

- System stress testing under various loads
- User journey validation and optimization
- Performance benchmarking across scenarios
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
