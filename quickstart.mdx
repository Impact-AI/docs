## Add your AI product

If your product is built using one of our AI platform [integration](/integrations) partners then use [Laila](/workflows/laila) directly on Impact AI to add your product. Laila will guide you through choosing the integration, adding credentials, and configuring endpoints.

## Impact AI SDK

For custom AI products, install the Impact AI SDK and instrument your code to capture traces.

### Step 1: Install the SDK

Install the Impact AI SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install impact
```

### Step 2: Initialize Tracing

In your Python application, initialize tracing as follows:

```python
from impact.sdk import Impact

# Initialization
Impact.init()
```

### Step 3: Annotate Your Workflows

For complex workflows, decorate your functions to capture detailed traces:

```python
from impact.sdk.decorators import workflow

@workflow(name="agent_workflow")
def execute_agent():
    # Your agent workflow here
    return result
```

### Step 4: Set Association Properties

Set the user and interaction identifiers for trace association:

```python
Impact.set_association_properties({
  user_id: "user_001",
  interaction_id: "chat_001"
})
```

### Step 5: Generate an API Key

In the Impact platform, create an API key for your environment/version:

- Go to Admin → API Keys → Click "Generate New Key"
- Choose the product, version, and expiry time
- Copy the generated key and store it securely

You will use this key as `IMPACT_API_KEY` in the next step.

### Step 6: Configure Trace Exporting

Set the following **environment variables** to export your traces:

- `IMPACT_API_KEY`
- `IMPACT_URL`

The IMPACT_API_KEY is created in the UI. The IMPACT_URL is provided directly by Impact AI.

### Step 7: Add your Product and Vector DB endpoints

In the Impact platform, update your version settings:

- Select the dropdown for your Product -> select the Version → click "Edit"
- Enter your Product endpoint URL and API key
- Enter your Vector DB endpoint URL and API key
- Save changes

Now you can generate interactions and tests on the Impact platform.

## Viewing Your Traces

Once your application is instrumented, view your traces in the Impact AI dashboard. Explore detailed insights into each trace, including execution time, errors, and workflow structures.
