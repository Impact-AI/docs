## Connect your AI product

If your product is built using one of our AI platform [integration](/integrations) partners then use [Laila](/workflows/laila) directly on Impact AI to connect your product.

## Impact AI SDK

For custom AI products, install the Impact AI SDK and instrument your code to capture traces.

### Step 1: Install the SDK

Install the Impact AI SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install impact-sdk
```

### Step 2: Initialize Tracing

In your Python application, initialize tracing as follows:

```python
from impact.sdk import Impact

# Initialization
Impact.init()
```

### Step 3: Annotate Your Workflows

For complex workflows, decorate your functions to capture detailed traces:

```python
from impact.sdk.decorators import workflow

@workflow(name="agent_workflow")
def execute_agent():
    # Your agent workflow here
    return result
```

### Step 4: Configure Trace Exporting

Set the following environment variables to export your traces:

- `IMPACT_API_KEY`
- `IMPACT_URL`

Refer to the [documentation](/docs/impact-sdk) for more details.

## Viewing Your Traces

Once your application is instrumented, view your traces in the Impact AI dashboard. Explore detailed insights into each trace, including execution time, errors, and workflow structures.
