## Add your AI product

Before connecting, first add your product using the [Add Product](/add-product) guide.

If you're using one of our AI platform [integration](/integrations) partners, use [Laila](/workflows/laila) to do this automatically otherwise continue below.

## Instrument your code

Install the Impact AI SDK and instrument your code to capture traces.

### Step 1: Install the SDK

Install the Impact AI SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install impact
```

### Step 2: Initialize Tracing

In your Python application, initialize tracing as follows:

```python
# Import
from impact.sdk import Impact

# Initialize tracing
Impact.init()
```

<Tip>
  For best results place this code **after** all your other imports.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Annotate Workflows

Optional: For agent or RAG workflows, decorate your functions to capture detailed traces:

```python
from impact.sdk.decorators import workflow, task, tool

@workflow(name="agent_workflow")
def execute_agent():
    # Your agent workflow here
    return result

@task(name="agent_task")
def execute_task():
    # Agent logic you want to track
    return result

@tool(name="agent_tool")
def execute_tool():
    # Agent tool
    return result
```

<Tip>
  The <code>name</code> argument is optional. The function name will be used if name is not provided.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Set Association Properties

Set the user and interaction identifiers for trace association:

```python
Impact.set_association_properties({
  user_id: "user_001",
  interaction_id: "chat_001"
})
```

<Tip>
  Use the key-value pair to associate an interaction (session) and user id with the trace
</Tip>

### Step 5: Generate an API Key

In the Impact platform, create an API key for your environment/version:

- Go to Admin → API Keys → Click "Generate New Key"
- Choose the product, version, and expiry time
- Copy the generated key and store it securely

You will use this key as `IMPACT_API_KEY` in the next step.

### Step 6: Configure Trace Exporting

Set the following **environment variables** in your backend application to export your traces:

- `IMPACT_API_KEY`
- `IMPACT_URL`

<Tip>
  The <code>IMPACT_API_KEY</code> is created in step 5. Your <code>IMPACT_URL</code> is provided by Impact support.
</Tip>

## Viewing Your Traces

Now you can view traces in the Impact AI datasets page. Explore detailed insights into each trace, including execution time, errors, and workflow structures.
