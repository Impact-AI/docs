title: Self Hosted
description: "Welcome to the Impact AI Self-Hosted setup guide. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for provisioning and deploying the Impact Platform in a self-hosted, air-gapped environment."
---

## Get Started

Self-Hosted deployment lets you run the Impact AI platform entirely within your infrastructure with **no external connectivity** requirements. This option provides maximum control for air-gapped environments.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure subscription** with Contributor or Owner permissions
- **Microsoft Entra ID tenant** with permissions to register applications
- **Azure CLI** (version 2.50.0+)
- **Azure Bicep CLI** (version 0.17.0+)
- **jq** (for JSON processing)
- **Bash terminal**

## Required Package

Impact AI will provide you with:
- Deployment package containing Bicep templates and scripts
- Access to Azure Container Registry
- Configuration templates and documentation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Deployment Package">
    1. Clone the deployment repository from our secure distribution channel
    2. Extract the package contents to a local directory
    3. The package includes:
       - Bicep templates (`provision/*`)
       - Ancillary scripts (`scripts/*`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Deployment Parameters">
    1. Copy the parameters template to create your configuration:
       ```bash
       cp provision/parameters-template.json provision/parameters.json
       ```

    2. Edit `parameters.json` with your environment-specific values:
       - Environment
       - Location
       - Container registry credentials (provided by Impact AI)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provision Infrastructure">
    Run the main Bicep deployment:
    ```bash
     az deployment sub create \
      --name <deployment> \
      --template-file provision/main-sub.bicep \
      --parameters provision/parameters-prod.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating Applications

When updates are available, Impact AI will provide updated container images and deployment scripts:

1. Import updated container images:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-apps.sh \
     --environment your-environment \
     --services service-to-update \
     --acr localhost:5000 \
     --acr-username your-username \
     --acr-password your-password
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Container Registry Authentication Failures**
   - Verify registry credentials
   - Check network connectivity to the registry

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check database credentials
   - Ensure firewall rules allow connections

3. **Application Configuration Problems**
   - Verify App Configuration settings
   - Check environment variables in container deployments

4. **Entra ID Configuration Issues**
   - Verify application registrations have correct permissions
   - Check that redirect URIs match your deployment URL
   - Ensure client secrets haven't expired
   - Confirm API permissions are properly granted and consented
   - Verify that users have appropriate directory roles assigned

## Security Considerations

- The platform is deployed within a virtual network with network security groups
- Private endpoints are used for all Azure PaaS services
- All authentication is handled through Microsoft Entra ID tenant
- Service-to-service authentication uses managed identities
- All data remains within your Azure subscription and region
- Regular security audits should be performed

## Benefits of Self-Hosted

- **Complete Data Sovereignty**: All data and processing remains within your infrastructure.
- **Security Control**: Full control over security policies, network rules, and access management.
- **Environment Customization**: Tailor the deployment to your specific requirements.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Satisfy strict regulatory requirements for sensitive workloads.
