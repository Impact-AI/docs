# Quickstart: Impact AI

Welcome to the Quickstart guide for Impact AI. This guide will help you instrument your AI application using two powerful tracing tools:

- **OpenLLMetry** for low-level instrumentation and detailed workflow annotations.
- **HoneyHive** for end-to-end observability and seamless trace integration.

## Using OpenLLMetry for Tracing

OpenLLMetry leverages the Traceloop SDK to instrument your code quickly.

### Step 1: Install the SDK

Install the Traceloop SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install traceloop-sdk
```

### Step 2: Initialize the Tracer

In your Python application, initialize OpenLLMetry as follows:

```python
from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop

# Basic initialization
Traceloop.init()

# If running locally and you want immediate trace output, disable batch sending
Traceloop.init(disable_batch=True)
```

### Step 3: Annotate Your Workflows

For complex workflows, decorate your functions to capture detailed traces:

```python
from traceloop.sdk.decorators import workflow

@workflow(name="process_data")
def process_data(input_data):
    # Your processing logic here
    return result
```

### Step 4: Configure Trace Exporting

Set the following environment variables to export your traces:

- `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`
- `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`

Refer to the [OpenLLMetry documentation](https://www.traceloop.com/docs/openllmetry/getting-started-python) for more details.

## Using HoneyHive for Observability

HoneyHive provides an easy-to-use tracer for AI applications.

### Step 1: Install the HoneyHive SDK

Install the HoneyHive SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install honeyhive
```

### Step 2: Initialize HoneyHiveTracer

Initialize the HoneyHive tracer in your application:

```python
from honeyhive import HoneyHiveTracer

HoneyHiveTracer.init(
    api_key="YOUR_HONEYHIVE_API_KEY",
    project="YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
)
```

### Step 3: Trace Your Functions

Use the `@trace` decorator to capture additional details about your functions:

```python
from honeyhive import trace

@trace
def fetch_results(query):
    # Your function logic
    return results
```

For more details, check out the [HoneyHive Quickstart documentation](https://docs.honeyhive.ai/introduction/quickstart).

## Viewing Your Traces

Once your application is instrumented, view your traces in the Impact AI dashboard. Explore detailed insights into each trace, including execution time, errors, and workflow structures.
