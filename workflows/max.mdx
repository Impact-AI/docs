## Overview

Max is your AI Product Manager agent for organizing and driving the lifecycle of any product you manage on Impact AI. Max structures work into three core areas that mirror how product teams think:

- Strategy – Set direction, outcomes, and guardrails
- Opportunity – Identify, size, and prioritize problems to solve
- Viability – Assess feasibility, risk, cost, and constraints

Max’s hexagonal Home screen groups your work into widgets and modules, with clear completion status and alerts so you always know what to do next.

## Core concepts

- Pages: Strategy, Opportunity, Viability
- Widgets: Logical groupings (e.g., Objectives, KPIs, Risks, Personas, Roadmap)
- Modules: The editable units inside a widget (e.g., a single Objective with Key Results)
- Actions: Contextual operations such as “Add Objective”, “Link KPI”, “Create Initiative”, and “Share”
- Product context: Everything you enter in Max stays scoped to the current product and is reused across agents (e.g., tests in Sage, analytics in Orion, policies in Laila)

## Set up your product with Max (step‑by‑step)

1) Strategy
- Define your North Star outcome
- Add 3–5 Objectives with measurable Key Results
- Link Objectives to KPIs you already track (or create new KPIs)
- Capture Constraints (compliance, safety, latency, cost) and Stakeholders

2) Opportunity
- Describe target segments and key Jobs‑to‑be‑Done
- Capture Problems, Evidence, and Assumptions
- Create Hypotheses and planned Experiments
- Size opportunities and add Priority

3) Viability
- Identify Risks (technical, legal, operational) and Mitigations
- Estimate Cost, Latency, and Reliability targets
- Record Dependencies and rollout constraints

## User Personas

Ground your Strategy and Opportunity work with clear, data‑backed personas. Personas in Impact AI are reusable across a product and can be turned into synthetic users for tests and simulations.

- What to include
  - **Profile**: name, role, seniority, industry/segment, geography
  - **Goals**: desired outcomes and success criteria
  - **Pain points**: blockers, risks, and constraints
  - **Behaviors**: frequency of use, channels, decision style
  - **Environment**: tools, data access, policies/compliance needs
  - **KPIs**: how this persona measures success

- How to create
  1. Go to Executors → [User Persona](/executors/user-persona)
  2. Start with existing customer data (interviews, tickets, analytics) or ask Max in Work Chat to summarize inputs into draft personas
  3. Capture 3–5 core attributes per section; keep it concise and testable
  4. Tag personas with segment labels you will use elsewhere (e.g., “Ops”, “Analyst”, “Manager”)

- Validation loop (recommended by Clueso)
  - Seed with qualitative evidence; enrich with product analytics
  - Run a quick survey/interview to confirm goals and pains
  - Pilot tasks with this persona and compare outcomes vs. stated KPIs
  - Revisit quarterly; retire or merge rarely used personas

- Using personas across the platform
  - **Prioritization**: Link personas to Opportunities to make trade‑offs explicit
  - **Testing**: Convert personas to Synthetic Users for scenario coverage (Executors → Synthetic Users)
  - **Simulations**: Combine personas and flows to validate UX and guardrails at scale (Executors → Simulations)
  - **Analytics**: Segment Orion dashboards by persona tags to spot adoption gaps
  - **Control**: Map persona constraints (privacy, PII, safety) to Laila policies

Tip: Keep one primary persona per product phase to focus execution. Secondary and edge personas can inform constraints and test scenarios without diluting the primary objective.

## Working with Max

- Dual chat: Use Work Chat to edit live artifacts; use General Chat for guidance and exploration
- Status indicators: Each widget shows completion and freshness so you can spot gaps fast
- Actions menu: Quickly add Objectives, KPIs, Experiments, or Risks without leaving context
- Versioning: Changes are tracked so you can review how strategy evolved

## Linked workflows across agents

- Tests (Sage): Turn Objectives and KPIs into test gates. Example: link a “First‑response accuracy ≥ 85%” KPI to a Sage assertion suite
- Analytics (Orion): Monitor KPI trends and correlate with changes to prompts, models, or releases
- Control (Laila): Enforce policy and safety constraints captured in Strategy/Viability

## Best practices

- Make Objectives measurable and time‑bound; link each to at least one KPI
- Keep Opportunities problem‑focused; validate assumptions with lightweight experiments
- Treat Viability as live guardrails (latency, cost, safety) and connect to Control for enforcement
- Review weekly: Update status, close completed work, and adjust priorities based on evidence

## FAQs

- Multiple products? Max scopes everything to the currently selected product. Switch products from the sidebar; each has its own Strategy, Opportunities, and Viability.
- Can I import existing artifacts? Yes—paste content into modules or ask Max in Work Chat to ingest docs and extract Objectives/KPIs.
- How do I keep everything in sync? Link KPIs to Orion dashboards and wire Objectives to Sage tests so progress reflects real usage and quality.
