## Overview

Max is your AI Product Manager agent designed to help you navigate the complete product lifecycle through three core areas: **Strategy**, **Opportunity**, and **Viability**. Max uses an intuitive hexagonal interface to organize your product management work.

## Max Home Screen

The Max interface features a distinctive hexagonal design with Max's avatar at the center, surrounded by the three main **Pages**:

- **Strategy** - Define your product direction and strategic objectives
- **Viability** - Assess product feasibility and sustainability  
- **Opportunity** - Identify and analyze market opportunities

The left sidebar provides quick navigation between different agents (Laila, Strategy, Opportunity, Viability, Discovery, etc.), while the top navigation includes **Overview** and **Actions** buttons for additional functionality.

<Tip>
The hexagonal interface isn't just aesthetic - it represents the interconnected nature of product management decisions across all three core areas.
</Tip>

## Page View

When you select a page (such as **Strategy**), Max displays all available **Widgets** in hexagonal cards, each showing:

- **Widget Name** (e.g., Goals, Challenges, Value Proposition)
- **Completion Status** with percentage indicators
- **Last Updated** timestamps
- **Alert Status** when attention is needed

### Strategy Page Widgets
From the interface, the Strategy page includes widgets such as:
- **Goals** - Set and track strategic objectives
- **Challenges** - Identify and address potential obstacles  
- **Value Proposition** - Define your product's unique value
- **Scenarios** - Plan for different market conditions
- **Compass** - Navigate strategic direction

Each widget displays real-time progress metrics (like "50% Completed" or "30% Tested") to help you understand where work is needed.

## Widget View - Deep Dive

Clicking on any widget opens a detailed **Module View** where you can work on specific components. For example, the **Goals** widget contains an **Objectives** module with specific, measurable goals such as:

- **Enhance Space Knowledge** - Increase user understanding through interactive learning
- **Real-time Mission Updates** - Provide live information within 24 hours
- **User Engagement** - Achieve target engagement rates through personalized content
- **Educational Outreach** - Collaborate with educational institutions 
- **Planetary Defense Awareness** - Raise awareness through virtual events

### Working with Max

Max provides a **dual chat system** visible in the top-right corner of the widget view:

- **Work Chat** - Collaborate directly with Max to make changes and updates to your modules
- **General Chat** - Ask questions and get guidance without making modifications

<Note>
The Work chat is your primary collaboration tool - Max can actively help you develop objectives, refine strategies, and update content based on your discussions.
</Note>

## Navigation Structure

The interface follows a clear hierarchy:
1. **Home** → Select your focus area (Strategy, Opportunity, Viability)
2. **Page View** → See all available widgets with status indicators  
3. **Widget View** → Work on specific modules within each widget
4. **Module Detail** → Use Max's chat system to refine and develop content

## Key Features

- **Visual Progress Tracking** - See completion percentages and status at a glance
- **Hexagonal Interface** - Intuitive design that reflects interconnected workflows
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Direct interaction with Max through the chat system
- **Hierarchical Organization** - Clear structure from high-level strategy to specific objectives
- **Alert System** - Notifications when areas need attention
- **Cross-Navigation** - Easy switching between different agents and focus areas

<Tip>
Max excels at helping you maintain strategic alignment while managing day-to-day product decisions. Use the visual indicators to quickly identify which areas need your attention.

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to add images

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

## Embeds and HTML elements

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
></iframe>

<br />

<Tip>

Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html). This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.

</Tip>

### iFrames

Loads another HTML page within the document. Most commonly used for embedding videos.

```html
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"> </iframe>
```
