## Overview

Iris is your AI evaluation agent designed to help you thoroughly test and analyze your product through data-driven insights and comprehensive evaluation frameworks.

## Iris Home Screen

Similar to other agents, Iris organizes work around three main **Pages**:

- **Strategy** - Evaluate strategic alignment and effectiveness
- **Opportunity** - Assess market opportunities and potential
- **Viability** - Analyze product viability through various metrics

Each page contains **Widgets** (shown as dropdowns) that provide specific evaluation tools and frameworks. At the top of the interface, you can create:

- **Artificial Users** - Simulated user profiles for testing scenarios
- **Simulations** - Run controlled tests and scenarios
- **Module Generator** - Create custom evaluation modules

<Note>
Ignore the "Runs" section during your initial setup - focus on the three creation tools mentioned above.
</Note>

## Page View

When you navigate to any of the pages (Strategy, Opportunity, or Viability), you'll see **statistics and metrics** displayed for each Widget. This gives you immediate insights into the evaluation status and performance of different areas.

The statistical overview helps you quickly identify which areas need attention and which are performing well.

## Widget View

Within each Widget, you can see **detailed statistics** for individual Modules. This granular view allows you to:

- Analyze specific metrics for each module
- Compare performance across different evaluation criteria  
- Identify trends and patterns in your evaluation data
- Make data-driven decisions about your product

## Key Capabilities

### Evaluation Framework
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis** - Evaluate across strategy, opportunity, and viability dimensions
- **Statistical Insights** - Get comprehensive metrics and analytics for each component
- **Module-level Granularity** - Drill down to specific evaluation areas

### Testing Tools
- **Artificial Users** - Create simulated user profiles for comprehensive testing
- **Simulation Environment** - Run controlled scenarios to test different conditions
- **Custom Module Generation** - Build specific evaluation frameworks for your needs

### Data-Driven Insights
- **Real-time Statistics** - See immediate feedback on evaluation metrics
- **Performance Tracking** - Monitor changes and improvements over time
- **Comparative Analysis** - Compare different approaches and strategies

<Tip>
Iris excels at providing objective, data-driven evaluation of your product decisions. Use the statistical views to validate assumptions and guide your product development process.

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best use to subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right.

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/writing-content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component.

<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>

```md
<Latex>8 x (vk x H1 - H2) = (0,1)</Latex>
```
