# Control (Laila)

Laila is the control agent that helps you add new products to the Impact AI platform. Laila guides you through product onboarding end‑to‑end: choosing an integration, securely adding credentials, configuring endpoints, setting up environments/versions, and validating everything so your product is ready to use across Impact AI.

## Why Control matters

- **Faster onboarding**: Standardized, guided steps to add new products without guesswork.
- **Correct by default**: Validates credentials, endpoints, and permissions before you go live.
- **Consistent environments**: Ensures products are configured the same way across dev, staging, and prod.

## Key capabilities

- **Product Onboarding Wizard** – Add a new product via a guided UI with clear progress and checks.
- **Integrations** – Connect to major AI platforms; discover projects/models where supported.
- **Credential & Endpoint Setup** – Securely store API keys; configure product and vector DB endpoints.
- **Environment & Version Management** – Create versions per environment and keep configuration in sync.
- **Connection Tests & Health Checks** – One‑click validation to ensure everything works before enabling.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Choose integration** – Select your AI platform integration or "Custom" if using the Impact AI SDK.
2. **Authenticate** – Add API keys or OAuth credentials; Laila verifies scope and validity.
3. **Configure endpoints** – Provide Product and Vector DB endpoints and associated keys.
4. **Set environments/versions** – Create dev/staging/prod versions and inherit or override config.
5. **Validate** – Run built‑in connection tests; fix any issues surfaced by Laila.
6. **Enable** – Turn on the product so it is available to tests, workflows, and analytics across Impact AI.

<Tip>
Combine Laila with **Orion** for deep behavioural analytics and **Sage** for regression testing. Together they deliver end‑to‑end onboarding quality and continuous reliability across the product lifecycle.

## Information Laila will ask for

- Product endpoint URL and API key
- Vector DB endpoint URL and API key
- Integration account/project details (where applicable)
- Desired environments and version names

## Best Practices

1. **Use environments** – Mirror your SDLC (dev/staging/prod) and promote configuration forward.
2. **Validate before enabling** – Always run Laila’s connection tests to catch issues early.
3. **Scope credentials** – Restrict API keys to the minimum permissions needed per environment.
4. **Document ownership** – Record who owns each product and how to rotate credentials.
